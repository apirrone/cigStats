# cigStats

I quit smoking, I had to think about something else for a while so I wrote this to keep myself busy.

## Build : 
	$ make cigStats
	
	
## Setup :
	$ ./cigStats --setup
	
## Protip : 
Setup an alias in your .bashrc that calls the program so that when you feel like going for a smoke, you can pop up a terminal, type something like "cig", and remind yourself of how far you've gone.
